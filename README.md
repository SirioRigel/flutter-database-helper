# flutter-databse-helper
An integration of a sql database that works for flutter projects which uses a general implementation of the package `sqflite`.
It uses also two other packages to help provide the application string to the app's folder.
Here I have used a custom Object called Water, from one of my projects to demonstrate how to use such an object with the database.
More on the dependencies in [dependencies]

## How to use it
1. Download the DatabaseHelper.dart file;
2. Place it in your project's lib folder;
3. Add ```WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();``` inside the main method of your app;
4. Call an instance of it wherever you want to use it.

### Adding an object into the database
```dart
  Water w = new Water(
      waterDrunk: 1000,
      dailyWater: 2500,
  );  
  // The id will be autogenerated
  // Adds the object into a specific table in the database
  DatabaseHelper.instance.AddWater(w);
```
It's possible to also create a general method that takes an argument for the table you want to put the object in.

### Getting a list of objects
```dart
  // Using the object inserted in the code above
  List<Water> list = await DatabaseHelper.instance.GetTable();
  for(var v in list) print(v.waterDrunk); // 1000
```
Note how the await keyword is **required** because we are calling an external tool.

### Update an object
```dart
  Water w = new Water(
    waterDrunk: 1000,
    dailyWater: 2500
  );
  int id = 0;
  DatabaseHelper.instance.Update(w, id); // New value for waterDrunk = 1000;
```

### Remove an object
```dart
  int id = 0;
  DatabaseHelper.instance.RemoveWater(id); // Removes the object with id = 0;
```

### Remove a table
```dart
  DatabaseHelper.instance.DeleteTable("water");
```
